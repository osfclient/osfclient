The ``osfclient`` is a python library and a command-line client for up-
and downloading files to and from your `Open Science
Framework <//osf.io>`__ projects. The *Open Science Framework* (OSF) is
an open source project which facilitates the open collaboration of
researchers on the web, by sharing data and other research outputs.

As such the OSF hosts large data sets, associated with papers or
scientific projects, that can be freely downloaded. The *osfclient*
allows people to store and retrieve large datasets associated to their
scientific projects and papers on the OSF via the command line
interface. If you are completely new to the OSF you can `read their
introductory materials <https://cos.io/our-products/osf>`__

This is a very new project, it has some rough edges.

Installing
==========

To use ``osfclient`` install it via pip:

::

    $ pip install osfclient

For details on participating in the development of ``osfclient`` check
out the `Contributing
section <https://github.com/osfclient/osfclient#contributing>`__.

Usage
=====

This project provides two things: a python library and a command-line
program for interacting with files stored in the
`OSF <https://osf.io/>`__.

The python library forms the basis for the command-line program. If you
want programmatic access to your files use the library, otherwise try
out the command-line program.

Below are some examples on how to use it:

::

    # get help and see available commands, get help on a specific command
    $ osf -h
    $ osf <command> -h

    # setup a local folder for an existing project
    $ osf init

    # list all files for the project
    $ osf ls

    # fetch all files for the project
    $ osf clone

    # fetch an individual file from a project
    $ osf fetch remote/path.txt local/file.txt

    # get web view url for an individual file from a project
    $ osf geturl remote/path.txt

    # add a new file
    $ osf upload local/file.txt remote/path.txt

    # add a new directory
    $ osf upload -r local/directory/ remote/directory

    # list all wiki pages for an existing project(/component)
    osf -p <project id> -u <username> list_wikis

    # clone all wiki pages for an existing project(/component)
    osf -p <project id> -u <username> clone_wikis <output directory>

If the project is private you will need to provide authentication
details.  You can provide either username & password credentials or a
Personal Access Token (PAT).  You can provide these by setting either
the ``OSF_USERNAME`` and ``OSF_PASSWORD`` environment variables or by
setting the ``OSF_TOKEN`` environment variable. The password will be
retrieved from the ``OSF_PASSWORD`` environment variable or you will
be asked directly by the tool when you run it.

You can set default values for the username and project by using a
configuration file in the current directory. This is what ``osf init``
does for you. To set the username and project ID create
``.osfcli.config``:

::

    [osf]
    username = yourOSFaccount@example.com
    project = 9zpcy

To avoid having to provide credentials on each use, you can provide
either your password or a PAT in your config with the following keys:

::

    # basic auth (username/password)
    password = this-password-is-fake

    # token auth
    token = kej2R9IU6Gr2uThsswSNdP1cd0cu9eaCerVXjVf7zNwfXHyT0QzMZtX0PGTYmp9Fzaixwq

After which you can simply run ``osf ls`` to list the contents of the
project.
